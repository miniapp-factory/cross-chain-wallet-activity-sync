#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve:

1. Updating **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** to set the new title and description.  
2. Creating a new file **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** that describes the logo image to generate.

Please add the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact search/replace block for that file. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create the `logo.png.todo` file.
